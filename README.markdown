Learning Cocos2D(x)
===================

The Toronto NSCoder group is running a book club for
*Learning Cocos2D* by Rod Strougo and Ray Wenderlich. I'm a cocos2d
n00b myself, but I figured I would put a spin on things and learn
the C++ based cocos2d-x while following along with the book.

I'll post code from my projects (probably one per chapter) here. Follow
along, fork, send pull requests, etc.
