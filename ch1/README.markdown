Hello, Cocos2D!
===============

This is the "Hello, Cocos2D" project from chapter 1 of the
Strougo/Wenderlich book *Learning Cocos2D*.

Interesting bits
----------------

* CCSprite. My first object!

* The `create()` static methods return autoreleased objects.

* Alternatively, you can use classic C++ `new` followed by an `init()`
  method and then call `release()` yourself. I think.
